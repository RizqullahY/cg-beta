# Click Game Beta

This repository is dedicated to a click-based game. Initially, the project started as a Tower of Hanoi game, but the direction changed to create a more engaging click game instead.

## Features

- **Login**: Users can log in to play the game.
- **Game**: The core click game experience is available.
- **Leaderboard** (Coming Soon): A leaderboard will be available in a future update to show top players and their scores.
